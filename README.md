## Why?

**NO LEGAL ADVICE**

If you are going in production with your React-Native app, you have to attribute all the Open Source packages you use. Because you have to include all dep tree, it's quite a lot. Nobody wants to do it manually. There are tools which you can use to get all the packages w/ liceses. But there wasn't one to pack all the informaiton in a string (or better a array of strings) to use in the app. why an array? because one stirng would be too much. We can use FlatList to show it one after each other. It's not so easier, because the information in the package.jons is mostl incomplete.
